# todo-list

https://joriordan332.github.io/todo-list/

A simple Todo list created with HTML, CSS & Javascript. The project drew upon previous lessons around modules, dynamically creating factories or constructors/classes in order to add tasks and projects to the todo list and made me conscious of trying to follow the OOP principles of the previous lesson. The project also makes use of localStorage which was something new to me up until now. The project was a learning curve for how to implement filters and localStorage
